# Polymer-Toolbox
A collection of Python scripts for LAMMPS to aide in polymer simulation

Static Structure Factor

```Measures static structure factor from the radial distribution function in LAMMPS. Has two scripts to plot the radial distribution function and the static structure factor using python```

PolyGen

```Polygen relies on Moltemplate and genpoly by Andrew Jewett. The script automates the process for creating polymer input files for LAMMPS```
